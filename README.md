## Notes

For some reason, I would always get the a yellow triangle with the message "Variable x has not been mutated,considering changing to 'let' constant" when I would try to use "var". I ended up using 'let' many times instead of "var". 
In the future, I would like to learn how to make the orientation of the view change with the orientation of the landscape, and I would like to make it possible for the app to allow the user to input the number of people sharing the meal and divide up tip by that number.
